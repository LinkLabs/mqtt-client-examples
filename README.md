# MQTT Client Examples

A repository of different programming languages and libraries providing examples of MQTT implementations that integrate directly to the Link Labs MQTT Credentials Object and MQTT ecosystem.

## Getting MQTT Credentials

Once you have been registered in the Airfinder Platform with an Organization, you will need the admin level permissions to generate MQTT Crednetials.

### Via the Airfinder Platform UI

Go to the Configuration > Subscriptions menu. If this menu is not availible then your account does not have the sufficient admin level permissions.

Once there, you can view any existing credentials or "Add Subscription" to create a new pair.
